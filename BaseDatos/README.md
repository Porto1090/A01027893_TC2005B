## Normalization
The database schema is normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF):

### - First Normal Form (1NF)

All columns contain atomic values.
Each table has a primary key.

### - Second Normal Form (2NF)

All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

### - Third Normal Form (3NF)

All attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key (no transitive dependencies).
